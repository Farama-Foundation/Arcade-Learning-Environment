/* *****************************************************************************
 * Hangman findings.
 *
 * Character encoding:
 * A: 0x00 --> Z: 0x19, with 0x1a representing a null character.
 *
 * Maximum word length is 6 letters, minimum word length is 3 letters, with the
 * first letter of the current word stored at location ram_f3, and the last at
 * ram_f8 (0x1a is used to fill in the blanks where a word is less than 6
 * letters).
 *
 * e.g. CAT would be represented as |0x02|0x00|0x13|0x1a|0x1a|0x1a|
 *
 * Location ram_fd contains a bit pattern representing the status of the current
 * word.  Bits 5-0 each represent a letter, while bits 7-6 are unused.
 * A set bit represents the known state of a letter, so in our example above
 * ram_fd would be initialised to %00000111 when a new word is set.  Once the
 * word has been completely guessed, game would expect to find %00111111 (0x3f)
 * and terminate.
 *
 * Location ram_ef contains the current player selected letter (same encoding
 * as above).
 *
 * Location ram_eb contains player 1(the guesser)'s score.
 *
 * Location ram_ec contains player 2(the setter)'s score.
 *
 * Location ram_ee contains the currently selected game mode.
 *
 * Resetting the game generates a new word, but maintains the player scores
 * across resets.
 *
 * Location ram_f1 contains a game timer, and counts off 0xff seconds before
 * properly terminating a game.  When a game is terminated it goes into a colour
 * cycling mode, whilst maintaining the player scores.  A subsequent reset here
 * will reset the player scores.
 * The game timer is reset back to 0x00 every time the player guesses a letter.
 *
 * Location ram_fe contains a turn timer, which only has an effect in advanced
 * mode.  After 20 seconds (in advanced mode), the player loses a guess (the
 * next part of the hanging monkey is drawn).
 * The turn timer is reset back to 0x00 every time the player guesses a letter.
