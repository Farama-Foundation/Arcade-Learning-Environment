/**
  This is the cartridge class for Tigervision's bankswitched
  games with RAM (basically, 3F plus up to 32K of RAM). This
  code is basically Brad's Cart3F code plus 32K RAM support.

  In this bankswitching scheme the 2600's 4K cartridge
  address space is broken into two 2K segments.  The last 2K
  segment always points to the last 2K of the ROM image.

  The lower 2K of address space maps to either one of the 2K ROM banks
  (up to 256 of them, though only 240 are supposed to be used for
  compatibility with the Kroko Cart and Cuttle Cart 2), or else one
  of the 1K RAM banks (up to 32 of them). Like other carts with RAM,
  this takes up twice the address space that it should: The lower 1K
  is the read port, and the upper 1K is the write port (maps to the
  same memory).

  To map ROM, the desired bank number of the first 2K segment is selected
  by storing its value into $3F. To map RAM in the first 2K segment
  instead, store the RAM bank number into $3E.

  This implementation of 3E bankswitching numbers the ROM banks 0 to
  256, and the RAM banks 256 to 287. This is done because the public
  bankswitching interface requires us to use one bank number, not one
  bank number plus the knowledge of whether it's RAM or ROM.

  All 32K of potential RAM is available to a game using this class, even
  though real cartridges might not have the full 32K: We have no way to
  tell how much RAM the game expects. This may change in the future (we
  may add a stella.pro property for this), but for now it shouldn't cause
  any problems. (Famous last words...)
