/**
  This is the cartridge class for Chris Wilkson's Megacart.  It does not 
  handle battery-backed RAM at this time and the code could use some serious 
  speed improvements.  It is based on the following Megacart specification:


  Megacart Specification, Rev1.1
  (c) 1997 Chris Wilkson
  cwilkson@mit.edu

  Description
  -----------

  The Megacart is an external memory cartridge for the Atari 2600 and compatible
  home video game consoles.  It plugs into the standard cartridge port, and
  contains a total of 128K bytes of ROM storage and 32K bytes of battery-backed
  RAM storage.

  General Operation
  -----------------

  The Megacart uses "bank switching" to fit the 160K bytes of physical memory
  into the console's available 4K address space.  Physical memory is divided
  into 64 RAM blocks of 512 bytes each, and 128 ROM blocks of 1K bytes each.
  RAM blocks are numbered $00 through $3F, and ROM blocks are numbered $80
  through $FF.

  The console's address space is divided into 4 slots of 1K each.  Any physical
  memory block can be switched into any memory slot by writing its block number
  to the "hot address" for the desired slot.  Memory locations $3C through $3F
  serve as "hot addresses" for memory slots 0 through 3, respectively.


  Example:

  To make ROM addresses $1A400-$1A7FF (block $E9) available to the console at
  memory locations $F800-$FBFF (slot 2), write $E9 to memory location $3e.

  Caution:

  Note that these memory locations are write only.  Trying to read the contents
  of memory locations $3C through $3F will not only return invalid data, but
  will also corrupt the contents causing the software to crash.  Reading these
  addresses should not be attempted.

  Special Case - RAM
  -------------------
  
  RAM blocks differ from ROM blocks in that one of the console's address lines,
  A9 in this case, must be used as a read/write select.  Because of this, RAM
  blocks are limited to 512 bytes each, yet still occupy an entire 1K slot.
  To store a value A9 must be low.  To retrieve a value A9 must high.

  Example:

  First, let's set slot 0 (console addresses $F000-$F3FF) to point to RAM
  block $9 (RAM $1200-$13ff).  To do this, write $9 to console address $3c.
  To store the value $69 in RAM location $1234, write $69 to console address
  $F034 (A9=0).  To retrieve the value of RAM location $1234, read from console
  address $F234 (A9=1).

  Special Case - Powerup
  -----------------------

  Because the console's memory is randomized at powerup, there is no way to
  predict the data initially contained in the "hot addresses".  Therefore,
  hardware will force slot 3 to always point to ROM block $FF immediately
  after any read or write to the RESET vector at $FFFC-$FFFD.  Block $FF
  must contain code to initialize the 4 memory slots to point to the desired
  physical memory blocks before any other code can be executed.  After program
  execution jumps out of the boot code, the hardware will release slot 3 and
  it will function just like any other slot.

  Example (the first column is the physical ROM address):

  $00C00    JUNK    ...     ; random code and data
            ...
            ...
            ...
            ...
  $1F400    START   ...     ; program starts here
            ...     ; slot 3 now points to rom block $83
            ...
            ...
            ...
  $1FFDD    BOOT    SEI     ; disable interrupts
  $1FFDE        CLD     ; set hexadecimal arithmetic mode
  $1FFDF        LDX #$FF    ; 
  $1FFE1        TXS     ; set stack pointer to $ff
  $1FFE2        LDA #$00 
  $1FFE4    ZERO    STA 00,X    ; clear RIOT and TIA -BEFORE- setting
  $1FFE6        DEX     ; up banks
  $1FFE7        BNE ZERO
  $1FFE9    BANKS   LDA #$00    ; ram block 0 ($0000-$01ff)
  $1FFEB        STA SLOT0   ; slot 0 points to ram block 0
  $1FFED        LDA #$34    ; ram block $34 ($6800-$69ff)
  $1FFEF        STA SLOT1   ; slot 1 points to ram block $34
  $1FFF1        LDA #$FD    ; rom block $fd ($1f400-$1f7ff)
  $1FFF3        STA SLOT2   ; slot 2 points to rom block $fd
  $1FFF5        LDA #$83    ; rom block $83 ($00C00-$01000)
  $1FFF7        STA SLOT3   ; slot 3 points to bootcode 
                    ; (rom block $ff)
                    ; until jumping out of slot 3
  $1FFF9        JMP $F800   ; jump to slot 2
  $1FFFC    RESET   .WORD   $FFDD   ; powerup reset vector
  $1FFFE    SWI .WORD   $FFDD   ; software interrupt vector (BRK)
