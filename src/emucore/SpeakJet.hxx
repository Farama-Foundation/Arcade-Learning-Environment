/**
  Emulation of the Magnevation SpeakJet.
  This is the speech synthesizer chip used in the AtariVox.
  See AtariVox.hxx and .cxx for AtariVox specifics.

  This class doesn't attempt 100% accurate emulation of the SpeakJet,
  as the chip contains a proprietary algorithm that does some complex
  modelling (in other words, it doesn't just string samples together).
  For this emulation, I use a library called rsynth, which does something
  similar (models the human vocal/nasal tract), but is implemented
  in a totally different way. You might say I'm emulating the spirit
  of the SpeakJet, not the letter :)

  Implementation details:

  Both rsynth and the SpeakJet take a stream of phoneme codes and produce
  audio output.

  My SpeakJet class accepts the SpeakJet phonemes, one at a time, and
  translates them to rsynth phonemes (which are not quite one-to-one
  equivalent). As each phoneme is translated, it's added to a phoneme
  buffer.

  Because of the way rsynth is implemented, it needs a full word's worth
  of phonemes in its buffer before its speech function is called. This
  means I'll only call rsynth_phones() when I receive a SpeakJet code that
  indicates a pause, or end-of-word, or a control code (set parameters
  or such). This will result in a slight delay (typically, games will
  send one SJ code per frame).

  Also due to rsynth's implementation, I have to run it in a thread. This
  is because rsynth_phones() is a monolithic function that needs a string
  of phonemes, and takes a while to run (for the word "testing", it takes
  1/4 second on an Athlon 64 @ 1800MHz). We can't have the emulator pause
  for a quarter second while this happens, so I'll call rsynth_phones()
  in a separate thread, and have it fill a buffer from which our main
  thread will pull as much data as it needs. A typical word will be
  30-40 thousand samples, and we only need fragsize/2 samples at a time.

  As always when using threads, there will be locking in play...

  rsynth's output is always 16-bit samples. This class will have to
  convert them to 8-bit samples before feeding them to the SDL audio
  buffer.

  When using the AtariVox, we'll use SDL stereo sound. The regular TIA
  sound will come out the left channel, and the speech will come out
  the right. This isn't ideal, but it's the easiest way to mix the two
  (I don't want to add an SDL_mixer dependency). The real SpeakJet uses a
  separate speaker from the 2600 (the 2600 TIA sound comes from the TV,
  the SJ sound comes from a set of PC speakers), so splitting them to
  the left and right channels isn't unreasonable... However, it means
  no game can simultaneously use stereo sound and the AtariVox (for now,
  anyway).
