## Description

You are a secret agent that must retrieve some secret documents and reach the ground level of a building by going down an elevator/stairs. Once you reach the ground level, you are picked up and taken to the next level. You are equipped with a gun to defend yourself against enemy agents waiting for you in each floor. You gather points by shooting down enemy agents and visiting apartments marked with a red door, which contain the secret documents. This is an unreleased prototype based on the arcade game.

For a more detailed documentation, see [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1131)

## Actions

ElevatorAction has the action space `Discrete(18)` with the table below listing the meaning of each action's meanings.
As ElevatorAction uses the full set of actions then specifying `full_action_space=True` will not modify the action space of the environment if passed to `gymnasium.make`.

| Value   | Meaning      | Value   | Meaning         | Value   | Meaning        |
|---------|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| `0`     | `NOOP`       | `1`     | `FIRE`          | `2`     | `UP`           |
| `3`     | `RIGHT`      | `4`     | `LEFT`          | `5`     | `DOWN`         |
| `6`     | `UPRIGHT`    | `7`     | `UPLEFT`        | `8`     | `DOWNRIGHT`    |
| `9`     | `DOWNLEFT`   | `10`    | `UPFIRE`        | `11`    | `RIGHTFIRE`    |
| `12`    | `LEFTFIRE`   | `13`    | `DOWNFIRE`      | `14`    | `UPRIGHTFIRE`  |
| `15`    | `UPLEFTFIRE` | `16`    | `DOWNRIGHTFIRE` | `17`    | `DOWNLEFTFIRE` |

See [environment specification](../env-spec) to see more information on the action meaning.

## Observations

Atari environments have three possible observation types:

- `obs_type="rgb"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="ram"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (128,), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="grayscale"` -> `Box(0, 255, (210, 160), np.uint8)`, a grayscale version of the q"rgb" type

See variants section for the type of observation used by each environment id by default.

### Reward

You start with 4 lives and are awarded 100 points for each enemy shot, and 500 points for each secret document collected (visiting a red door). Each time you get shot you lose one life and the game ends when losing all lives.

## Variants

ElevatorAction has the following variants of the environment id which have the following differences in observation,
the number of frame-skips and the repeat action probability.

| Env-id                       | obs_type=   | frameskip=   | repeat_action_probability=   |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| ElevatorActionNoFrameskip-v4 | `"rgb"`     | `1`          | `0.00`                       |
| ALE/ElevatorAction-v5        | `"rgb"`     | `4`          | `0.25`                       |

See the [version history page](https://ale.farama.org/environments/#version-history-and-naming-schemes) to implement previously implemented environments, e.g., `ElevatorActionNoFrameskip-v4`.

## Difficulty and modes

It is possible to specify various flavors of the environment via the keyword arguments `difficulty` and `mode`.
A flavor is a combination of a game mode and a difficulty setting. The table below lists the possible difficulty and mode values
along with the default values.

| Available Modes   | Default Mode   | Available Difficulties   | Default Difficulty   |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `[0]`             | `0`            | `[0]`                    | `0`                  |

## Version History

A thorough discussion of the intricate differences between the versions and configurations can be found in the general article on Atari environments.

* v5: Stickiness was added back and stochastic frame-skipping was removed. The environments are now in the "ALE" namespace.
* v4: Stickiness of actions was removed
* v0: Initial versions release
