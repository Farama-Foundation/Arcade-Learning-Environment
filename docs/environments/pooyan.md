This environment is part of the <a href='..'>Atari environments</a>. Please read that page first for general information.

For more Pooyan variants with different observation and action spaces, see the variants section.

## Description

You are a mother pig protecting her piglets (Pooyans) from wolves. In the first scene, you can move up and down a rope. Try to shoot the worker's balloons, while guarding yourself from attacks. If the wolves reach the ground safely they will get behind and try to eat you. In the second scene, the wolves try to float up. You have to try and stop them using arrows and bait. You die if a wolf eats you, or a stone or rock hits you.

For a more detailed documentation, see [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=372)

## Actions

Pooyan has the action space of `Discrete(6)` with the table below listing the meaning of each action's meanings.
To enable all 18 possible actions that can be performed on an Atari 2600, specify `full_action_space=True` during
initialization or by passing `full_action_space=True` to `gymnasium.make`.

| Value   | Meaning   | Value   | Meaning   | Value   | Meaning    |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| `0`     | `NOOP`    | `1`     | `FIRE`    | `2`     | `UP`       |
| `3`     | `DOWN`    | `4`     | `UPFIRE`  | `5`     | `DOWNFIRE` |

See [environment specification](../env-spec) to see more information on the action meaning.

## Observations

Atari environments have three possible observation types: `"rgb"`, `"grayscale"` and `"ram"`.

- `obs_type="rgb" -> observation_space=Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="ram" -> observation_space=Box(0, 255, (128,), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="grayscale" -> Box(0, 255, (210, 160), np.uint8)`, a grayscale version of the "rgb" type

See variants section for the type of observation used by each environment id by default.

### Rewards

If you hit a balloon, wolf or stone with an arrow you score points.
For a more detailed documentation, see [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=372).

## Variants

Pooyan has the following variants of the environment id which have the following differences in observation,
the number of frame-skips and the repeat action probability.

| Env-id        | obs_type=   | frameskip=   | repeat_action_probability=   |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| ALE/Pooyan-v5 | `"rgb"`     | `1`          | `0.00`                       |

See the [version history page](https://ale.farama.org/environments/#version-history-and-naming-schemes) to implement previously implemented environments, e.g., `PooyanNoFrameskip-v4`.

## Difficulty and modes

It is possible to specify various flavors of the environment via the keyword arguments `difficulty` and `mode`.
A flavor is a combination of a game mode and a difficulty setting. The table below lists the possible difficulty and mode values
along with the default values.

| Available Modes    | Default Mode   | Available Difficulties   | Default Difficulty   |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `[10, 30, 50, 70]` | `10`           | `[0]`                    | `0`                  |

## Version History

A thorough discussion of the intricate differences between the versions and configurations can be found in the general article on Atari environments.

* v5: Stickiness was added back and stochastic frame-skipping was removed. The environments are now in the "ALE" namespace.
* v4: Stickiness of actions was removed
* v0: Initial versions release
