This environment is part of the <a href='..'>Atari environments</a>. Please read that page first for general information.

For more Asterix variants with different observation and action spaces, see the variants section.

## Description

You are Asterix and can move horizontally (continuously) and vertically (discretely). Objects move horizontally across the screen including lyres and other (more useful) objects. Your goal is to guideAsterix in such a way as to avoid lyres and collect as many other objects as possible. You score points by collecting objects and lose a life whenever you collect a lyre. You have three lives available at the beginning. If you score sufficiently many points, you will be awarded additional points.

For a more detailed documentation, see [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=3325)

## Actions

Asterix has the action space of `Discrete(9)` with the table below listing the meaning of each action's meanings.
To enable all 18 possible actions that can be performed on an Atari 2600, specify `full_action_space=True` during
initialization or by passing `full_action_space=True` to `gymnasium.make`.

| Value   | Meaning   | Value   | Meaning     | Value   | Meaning    |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| `0`     | `NOOP`    | `1`     | `UP`        | `2`     | `RIGHT`    |
| `3`     | `LEFT`    | `4`     | `DOWN`      | `5`     | `UPRIGHT`  |
| `6`     | `UPLEFT`  | `7`     | `DOWNRIGHT` | `8`     | `DOWNLEFT` |

See [environment specification](../env-spec) to see more information on the action meaning.

## Observations

Atari environments have three possible observation types:

- `obs_type="rgb"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="ram"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (128,), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="grayscale"` -> `Box(0, 255, (210, 160), np.uint8)`, a grayscale version of the q"rgb" type

See variants section for the type of observation used by each environment id by default.

### Reward

A table of scores awarded for collecting the different objects is provided on [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=3325).

## Variants

Asterix has the following variants of the environment id which have the following differences in observation,
the number of frame-skips and the repeat action probability.

| Env-id                | obs_type=   | frameskip=   | repeat_action_probability=   |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| AsterixNoFrameskip-v4 | `"rgb"`     | `1`          | `0.00`                       |
| ALE/Asterix-v5        | `"rgb"`     | `4`          | `0.25`                       |

See the [version history page](https://ale.farama.org/environments/#version-history-and-naming-schemes) to implement previously implemented environments, e.g., `AsterixNoFrameskip-v4`.

## Difficulty and modes

It is possible to specify various flavors of the environment via the keyword arguments `difficulty` and `mode`.
A flavor is a combination of a game mode and a difficulty setting. The table below lists the possible difficulty and mode values
along with the default values.

| Available Modes   | Default Mode   | Available Difficulties   | Default Difficulty   |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `[0]`             | `0`            | `[0]`                    | `0`                  |

## Version History

A thorough discussion of the intricate differences between the versions and configurations can be found in the general article on Atari environments.

* v5: Stickiness was added back and stochastic frame-skipping was removed. The environments are now in the "ALE" namespace.
* v4: Stickiness of actions was removed
* v0: Initial versions release
